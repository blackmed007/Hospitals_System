# hospitals_system

Simple Hospitals_System Program using Python 


I'm currently updating the project: it will be ready around 13 August 

The program provides the following operations:

1) Add a new patient
2) Print all patients
3) Get the next patient
4) Remove a leaving patient
5) End the program

Note:

-There are 20 different specializations (e.g. Children, Surgery, etc)

-For each specialization, there are only 10 available spots, which will be sorted according to Status : 0 (normal), 1 (urgent), and 2 (super urgent)

-The program will keep running  Until the user chooses to exit.

-The program has an input validation function, that insure the input in the required type.

-The goal of the program is to build a basic OOP program and To Make use of Lists in Python
